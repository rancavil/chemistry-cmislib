Description: ABOUT
        -----
        
        Thanks for using cmislib, the CMIS client library for Python.
        
        The goal of this library is to provide an interoperable API to CMIS
        repositories such as Alfresco, Nuxeo, KnowledgeTree, MS SharePoint,
        EMC Documentum, and any other content repository that is CMIS-compliant.
        
        More info on CMIS can be found at:
        http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cmis
        
        This is a fork from https://github.com/apache/chemistry-cmislib and update to work with 
        Python 2.7 and 3.5.

        TESTS
        -----
        
        There are unit tests available in the tests directory. They require access
        to a CMIS provider. There are many freely-available CMIS repositories
        available to run locally or that are hosted.

        Documentation that tells you what this is all about can be found in the doc
        directory. Please see the doc for dependencies, required CMIS version level,
        required Python version, etc.
        
        NOTES:
        ------
        
        This is a working version, and has been tested on Python 3.5 and Alfresco Community - 5.1.0 (r127059-b7)
